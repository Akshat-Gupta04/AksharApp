## Tagline:
"Lost your translation? Never Again"

## Description:
Akshar is a chat application designed to break language barriers seamlessly. Users can set their default language, and messages from other users in different languages will be automatically translated to their preferred language, whether they are text or audio messages. We prioritize user experience by allowing users to view messages in both their secondary language and the original language it was written in, ensuring translation accuracy.

The application is built using Flutter, offering a smooth and dynamic user interface across multiple platforms. In addition to language translation features, Akshar includes fundamental chatting functionalities such as document, image, video, and location sharing.
